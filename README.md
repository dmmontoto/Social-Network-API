## Description

The Social Network API is a robust backend system for a social networking platform that allows users to create and share their thoughts, interact with other users' thoughts, and manage their friend connections. This API is designed to power the server-side of a social media application, providing essential functionality for users and their interactions. It was built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to store and manage user data, thoughts, reactions, and friend connections.

## Installation

For installation, there are some steps that should be followed after cloning this repository. First, the user needs to ensure the proper add-ons are inside of the package.json file. Importantly, please make sure to run `npm install express@4.17.1` and `npm install mongoose@7.0.2`. After having these dependencies added, the user can feel free to begin working and playing with the repo.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation, you can either seed some pre-made data into the database or run the server with no prior data. If the user chooses to add the seed data, the user can run `npm run seed` before `npm start`. Only run `npm start` to not have any seeded data. In order to test the routes on your own local server, please install Insomnia or a similar application to actaully test the different routes and getting data. Feel free to begin working with the project!
